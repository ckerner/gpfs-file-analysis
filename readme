Run list_files.sh <PATH>

This creates a /tmp/policy.<PID>/list.all-files

You feed that path to file_analysis.pl like such:

file_analysis.pl /tmp/policy.32594/list.all-files 

You can specify what type of analysis:
     Flag    Analysis Type
     -s      Breakdown by File Size
     -c      Breakdown by File Creation Days
     -m      Breakdown by File Modification Days
     -a      Breakdown by File Access Days
     -u      Breakdown by UID
     -g      Breakdown by GID
