This utility will perform some basic file analysis on a given tree of a GPFS file system.

You will need to modify the file_analysis.pl script to match your system. Here are the changes:
- $node_class will need to be modified to fit your system. We use a node class called 'coreio' which
  contains all of the NSD servers.
- $work_dir needs to be modified as well. It needs to point to a work directory within a shared file system. 

Usage: file_analysis.pl <Analysis Type> <Path To Analyze>

You can specify what type of analysis:
     Flag    Analysis Type
     -s      Breakdown by File Size
     -c      Breakdown by File Creation Days
     -m      Breakdown by File Modification Days
     -a      Breakdown by File Access Days
     -u      Breakdown by UID
     -g      Breakdown by GID
